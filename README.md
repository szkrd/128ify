# 128ify

Convert audio files to low bitrate mp3 files.

I backup my purchased music files locally, but sometimes I want to
listen them on the go, without messing around with iTunes or other crap,
so:

1. buy stuff on [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com), save to mp3 server on LAN
2. downgrade files at local copy
3. upload to own cloud
4. use a cloud player to download them to iDevice
5. enjoy

Shellscript only works on Linux, this node script is meant to be crossplatform.

## TODO

- [x] basic functionality (mirrors old shellscript)
- [x] colors
- [ ] parallel encoding
- [ ] better rename
- [ ] auto copy to sync dir
